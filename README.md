The calculator uses Python's Tkinter for the graphical user interface. It integrates mathematical capabilities through libraries like Sympy and NumPy, providing users with a wide array of functions and operations.


Key Features:

1. Basic Operations: Users can perform standard arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division directly from the interface

2. Scientific Functions: It functions like trigonometric calculations (sin, cos, tan), logarithms (log, ln), factorial (!), square root, and exponentiation (eˣ). It also supports operations like power (^), handling factorial (!), and constants such as π (pi).

3. Angle Modes: Users can switch between degrees (deg), radians (rad), and grads (grad) for trigonometric calculations.

4. History Tracking: The calculator maintains a history of the last 5 calculations, accessible via a dedicated window. This feature allows users to review recent computations conveniently

5. Additional Features: Users can toggle shift mode to access supplementary functions, change the sign of numbers (+/-), and convert between fraction and decimal formats (S⇔D).

6. Keyboard Support: Supports input via keyboard (but still limited).Right-click functionality allows users to copy-paste text input and manage history entries.

7. Theme: The calculator employs a dark theme

Limitations: It does not support operations involving complex numbers.
